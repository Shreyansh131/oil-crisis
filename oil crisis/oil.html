            1990s oil price shock:<br />
            The 1990 oil crisis was a major event that not only affected the global oil market and economy at the time, 
            but also had lasting effects on energy policy and international relations. Oil crisis was primarily triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.
            This attack halted oil production from Kuwait and raised fears of potential disruption from other countries in the region. Prices nearly doubled from $15 per
            barrel in July 1990 to about $40 per barrel by mid-October 1990.The sharp rise in oil prices led to inflation and recession in many countries, especially those heavily dependent on oil imports.

            2020 oil crisis:<br />
            In 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic oil and gas demand drop dramatically at global level. Lockdowns and travel restrictions paused transportation. As storage facilities filled up,
            there is oversupply crisis. Major oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia engaged in a price war, exacerbating the situation. The crisis severely impacted oil-dependent 
            economies, strained energy markets, and prompted emergency production cuts by OPEC+ to stabilise prices.
